## Usage

```
git clone git@github.com:chrisjohnson/home.git ~/.home
cd ~/.home
./init.sh
```

If this is an OS X machine, don't forget to update iTerm preferences: `Settings -> General -> Preferences -> Load preferences from a custom folder -> /Users/cjohnson/.home/.iterm-settings/` and then restart iTerm (don't save changes until after restarting)
